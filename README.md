TEXT MINING

Sentiment analysis is a common task in the field of Natural language processing (NLP). It is performed to identify and extract the sentiment or opinion of a sentence. Knowing the sentiment of a sentence is important for companies or brands to evaluate the impact of the sentences. However, we do not know which word is used for showing the sentiment. By extracting the keywords or keyphrases from a sentence, we are able to identify the sentiment of the sentence. 

In our project, we are extracting the words or phrases that were used for sentiment description from Tweets. We are trying to construct a model that can look at the labeled sentiment for a given tweet and figure out what word or phrase best supports it. We use nltk, SpaCy and RoBERTa models for training the data and find that RoBERTa produce the best result.
